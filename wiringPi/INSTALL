How to install wiringPi
=======================

The easiest way is to use the supplied 'build' script:

  ./build

that should do a complete install or upgrade of wiringPi for you.

That will install a dynamic library.

Some distributions do not have /usr/local/lib in the default LD_LIBRARY_PATH. To
fix this, you need to edit /etc/ld.so.conf and add in a single line:

  /usr/local/lib

then run the ldconfig command.

  sudo ldconfig

If you want to install a static library, you may need to do this manually:

  cd wiringPi
  make static
  sudo make install-static


To un-install wiringPi:

  ./build uninstall
